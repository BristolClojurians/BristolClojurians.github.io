<a id="welcome-to-the-bristol-clojure-community" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-the-bristol-clojure-community" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the Bristol Clojure Community</h3>
        <p>
         For the start of this year we are going to be working our way through the classic text book <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs">Structured Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> or SICP as it is generally refered to.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, we're not going to just read it. O no. Tried and failed at that. Instead we're going to piggy back along on the rather excellent idea that is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1751759988/sicp-distilled">SICP Distilled</a>, a project being created by the quite mavellous <a href="https://twitter.com/thattommyhall">Mr Tommy Hall</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a nut shell, each month (ish) Tommy is going to create a video summerising a chapter of the book and create exercises using <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a> to express the content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently we're thinking people will watch the video at their own convenience and we'll get together to do the exercises and generally have a chat about it.
        </p>

        <h3><a id="who-is-this-for" class="anchor" href="#who-is-this-for" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who is this for?</h3>
        <p>People interested in learning Clojure. We'll be doing the exercises in the language and they'll be a number of experienced people there who can answer any questions you might have.</p>
          <p>People interested in SICP. It's one of the classic text books on the Computer Programming. No matter what your experience level there are insights to be gained.</p>
          <p>People who like beer and/or pizza.</p>

          <h3><a id="how-do-get-involved" class="anchor" href="#how-do-you-get-invovled" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do you get involved?</h3>
        <p>
          Pop into our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bristolclojurians">Google Group</a> and say hello, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/bristolclojure">Twitter</a> or join us on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bristol-Clojurians/">Meetup</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't worry if you have no Clojure experience, just let us know! We can easily run an intro session to help people get laptops setup or explain the language.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Hopefully you'll join us for what is going to a memorable experience,
